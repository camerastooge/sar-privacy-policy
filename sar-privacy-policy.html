        <h3>Last Updated: February 3, 2026</h3>

        <p>This privacy policy explains how Stretch & Release (the “App”) handles your information.  In short, the app does not collect any personally identifiable information.  App settings are non-identifiable and stored strictly on your device.</p>

        <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do not collect, store or use any personal information, including your name, email, or any other identifiers such as your IP address.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The only data stored by the app is settings (timer duration, haptic/volume settings, etc.).  This data is stored on your physical device.  The only transfer of this data is between iPhone and Apple Watch, if you are using the WatchOS version of the app.</p>

        <h2>No Third Parties</h2>
        <p>This app does not integrate with any third party tracking or analytics tools.</p>

        <h2>Kid's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This is not a child-focused app.  This app does not collect data from any user.  Please monitor your child’s device usage.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Since the app does not collect or store your data, there is no risk of it being accessed through us.</p>

        <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>This policy will be updated as needed.  Please check the “last updated” section at the top of this page.</p>
